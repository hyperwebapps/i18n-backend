## Description

This is a README file for a REST API project that provides an internationalization (i18n) backend. The project is built with NEST JS, a progressive Node.js framework, MYSQL as the database, and PRISMA as the ORM (Object Relational Mapping) tool. The API provides multi-language support, allowing easy customization and implementation of various locales within your application. This project serves as a solid foundation for building robust, scalable, and internationalized web applications. Get started by cloning the repository, installing dependencies, and running the API on your local machine.
